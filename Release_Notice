Dear Soot Users,

We are pleased to announce that Soot version 2.4.0 is now available
at: http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/

This release contains the following additions and improvements:

1. Hossein Sadat-Mohtasham's implementation of program dependency graphs

2. Support for creating sound call graphs even for programs that use
   reflection, custom class loaders and runtime-generated classes.
   For this purpose, Soot uses TamiFlex to create a runtime log file that
   contains information about how refleciton is being used. Spark then
   uses the log file during call-graph and points-to graph construction.
   See http://code.google.com/p/tamiflex/wiki/DaCapoAndSoot for details.     
   
Also we incorporated fixes to numerous bugs. Thanks for reporting bugs
and/or providing fixes!   

See http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/CHANGES for details.

As of version 2.2.0 the Soot bugzilla is available at:
http://svn.sable.mcgill.ca/bugzilla/. We encourage you to add any Soot
bugs there.

Also, as of version 2.2.0 the Soot wiki is available at:
http://svn.sable.mcgill.ca/wiki/index.php/SootProject. The Soot team
will be using this site for discussing upcoming work, so if you would
like to know what's going on look there.
