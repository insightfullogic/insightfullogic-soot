Dear Soot Users,

We are pleased to announce that Soot version 2.2.5 is now available at:
http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/

This release contains the following additions and improvements:

1. Soot now has an option to prepend the classpath given on the command line to the default classpath
   (i.e. the one defined by the CLASSPATH environment variable).
   See the documentation on the option -pp for details.
2. Included Manu Shridharan's demand-driven context-sensitive refinement-based points-to analysis.
   See http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1133255.1134027 for details.
   It can be activated via: -p cg.spark cs-demand:true    
   Thanks a lot, Manu, for this great contribution!
3. Added local must-alias and not-may alias analyses. See package soot.jimple.toolkits.pointer.
4. Updated NullnessAnalysis for better performance. Thanks to Julian Tibble!
5. The flow analysis framework is now generic. One can explicitly declare the type of the abstraction and
   that is used for the fixed point iteration and the node type for the graph that is iterated over.
   This avoids a lot of casting one had to do in the past.
6. Between versions 2.2.3 and 2.2.4, a bug was introduced to Spark: PointsToSetInternal now implement
   equals/hashCode which confused the propagator algorithm because it was relying on comparison by identity.
   This lead to a five-fold slowdown on the points-to analyses and potentially wrong results.
   The bug has now been fixed by modifying the propagator algorithm. Original speed was restored.  

Due to the use of generics this version of Soot as well as all upcoming versions require to run on a
JVM supporting Java version 5 or higher. 

As of version 2.2.0 the Soot bugzilla is available at:
http://svn.sable.mcgill.ca/bugzilla/. We encourage you to add any Soot
bugs there.

Also, as of version 2.2.0 the Soot wiki is available at:
http://svn.sable.mcgill.ca/wiki/index.php/SootProject. The Soot team
will be using this site for discussing upcoming work, so if you would
like to know what's going on look there.
