SSA Jimple (aka Shimple)
========================

This is a first cut at an SSA version of Jimple for scalars, dubbed
Shimple.  The idea is that Shimple can be treated almost identically
as Jimple with the added benefit of SSA form.

The public API is described in soot.shimple.Shimple,
soot.shimple.ShimpleBody and soot.shimple.PhiExpr.

Use/Definition and Definition/Use chains for Shimple can be obtained
with soot.shimple.toolkits.scalar.ShimpleLocalDefs and
soot.toolkits.scalar.SimpleLocalUses.

Available example analyses with Shimple currently include:
soot.shimple.toolkits.scalar.{ShimpleLocalDefs,SEvaluator,SConstantPropagatorAndFolder}

Suggestions and improvements welcome!  Please send these either to the
Soot mailing list at soot-list@sable.mcgill.ca, or directly to myself
at navindra@cs.mcgill.ca.
