Shimple (aka SSA Jimple)
========================

This is a first cut at an SSA version of Jimple, dubbed Shimple.  The
idea is that Shimple can be treated almost identically to Jimple with
the added benefit of SSA form.

The public API is described in soot.shimple.Shimple,
soot.shimple.ShimpleBody and soot.shimple.PhiExpr.

Use/Definition and Definition/Use chains for Shimple can be obtained
with soot.shimple.toolkits.scalar.ShimpleLocalDefs and
soot.toolkits.scalar.SimpleLocalUses.

Available example analyses for Shimple currently include:
soot.shimple.toolkits.scalar.{ShimpleLocalDefs,SEvaluator,SConstantPropagatorAndFolder}

Suggestions, improvements and bug reports/fixes welcome!  Please send
these either to the Soot mailing list at soot-list@sable.mcgill.ca, or
directly to myself at navindra@cs.mcgill.ca.

TODO: Make internal analyses more useful and generic for external use.
TODO: Investigate why the Aggregator doesn't seem to work too well.
TODO: Write a Shimple parser?
TODO: Implement a Control Dependence Graph?  Any interest in that?
