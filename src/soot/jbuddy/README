This directory contains a JNI interface to the BuDDy BDD library. The
JNI interface is generated with swig. Currently, I am using version 1.3.17
of swig, and there appear to be big differences and incompatibilities between
code generated by different versions.

To rebuild the code in this directory:
1) change to the c subdirectory
1.9) download and build BuDDy somewhere. I used version 2.2.
2) create a symlink called buddy pointing to your BuDDy installation directory,
   so that buddy/src exists
3) create a symlink called java pointing to your JDK directory, so that
   java/include exists
4) run make on the provided makefile. I ran it with gcc 3.2.3.

To run Soot with BuDDy support, either add the directory containing
libjbuddy.so to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, or run the
Java VM with the switch -Djava.library.path=$DIRECTORY, replacing
$DIRECTORY with the directory containing libjbuddy.so.
