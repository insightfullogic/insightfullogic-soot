SECTION General Options
#######################

BOPT verbose
false
When this option is set to true, Spark prints detailed information.
END

BOPT ignoreTypesEntirely
false
When this option is set to true, all parts of Spark completely ignore
declared types of variables and casts.
END

BOPT forceGCs
false
When this option is set to true, calls to System.gc() will be made at
various points to allow memory usage to be measured.
END

BOPT preJimplify
false
When this option is set to true, convert all available methods to Jimple
before starting the points-to analysis. This allows the Jimplification
time to be separated from the points-to time. However, it increases the
total time and memory requirement, because all methods are Jimplified,
rather than only those deemed reachable by the points-to analysis.
END

SECTION Pointer Assignment Graph Building Options
#################################################

BOPT VTA
false
Setting VTA to true has the effect of setting ignoreBaseObjects,
typesForSites, and simplifySCCs to true to simulate Variable Type
Analysis, described in~\cite{sund.hend.ea00}. Note that the
algorithm differs from the original VTA in that it handles array
elements more precisely. To use the results of the analysis to trim the
invoke graph, set the trimInvokeGraph option to true as well.
END

BOPT RTA
false
Setting RTA to true sets typesForSites to true, and causes Spark to use
a single points-to set for all variables, giving Rapid Type
Analysis~\cite{baco.swee96}.
To use the results of the analysis to trim the invoke graph, set the
trimInvokeGraph option to true as well.
END

BOPT ignoreBaseObjects
false
When this option is set to true, fields are represented by variable
(Green) nodes, and the object that the field belongs to is ignored
(all objects are lumped together). Otherwise, fields are represented by
field reference (Red) nodes, and the objects that they belong to are
distinguished.
END

BOPT typesForSites
false
When this option is set to true, types rather than allocation sites are
used as the elements of the points-to sets.
END

BOPT mergeStringBuffer
true
When this option is set to true, all allocation sites creating
{\tt java.lang.StringBuffer} objects are grouped together as a single
allocation site.
END

BOPT simulateNatives
true
When this option is set to true, effects of native methods are simulated.
END

BOPT simpleEdgesBidirectional
false
When this option is set to true, all edges connecting variable (Green)
nodes are made bidirectional, as in Steensgaard's analysis~\cite{stee96*1}.
END

BOPT onFlyCallGraph
false
When this option is set to true, the call graph is computed on-the-fly
as points-to information is computed. Otherwise, an initial
approximation to the call graph is used.
END

BOPT parmsAsFields
false
When this option is set to true, parameters to methods are represented
as fields (Red nodes) of the this object; otherwise, parameters are
represented as variable (Green) nodes.
END

BOPT returnsAsFields
false
When this option is set to true, return values from methods are
represented as fields (Red nodes) of the this object; otherwise,
return values are represented as variable (Green) nodes.
END


SECTION Pointer Assignment Graph Simplification Options
#######################################################

BOPT simplifyOffline
false
When this option is set to true, variable (Green) nodes which are
connected by simple paths (so they must have the same points-to set) are
merged together.
END

BOPT simplifySCCs
false
When this option is set to true, variable (Green) nodes which form
strongly-connected components (so they must have the same points-to set)
are merged together.
END

BOPT ignoreTypesForSCCs
false
When this option is set to true, when collapsing strongly-connected
components, nodes forming SCCs are collapsed regardless of their type.
The collapsed SCC is given the most general type of all the nodes in the
component.

When this option is set to false, only edges connecting nodes of the
same type are considered when detecting SCCs.

This option has no effect unless simplifySCCs is true.
END

SECTION Points-To Set Flowing Options
#####################################

MOPT propagator iter worklist merge alias none
worklist
This option tells Spark which propagation algorithm to use.

Iter is a simple, iterative algorithm, which propagates everything until the
graph does not change.

Worklist is a worklist-based algorithm that tries
to do as little work as possible. This is currently the fastest algorithm.

Alias is an alias-edge based algorithm. This algorithm tends to take
the least memory for very large problems, because it does not represent
explicitly points-to sets of fields of heap objects.

Merge is an algorithm that merges all yellow nodes with their corresponding
red nodes. This algorithm is not yet finished.

None means that propagation is not done; the graph is only built and
simplified.
END

MOPT setImpl hash bit hybrid array double
double
Selects an implementation of a points-to set that Spark should use.

Hash is an implementation based on Java's built-in hash-set.

Bit is an implementation using a bit vector.

Hybrid is an implementation that keeps an explicit list of up to
16 elements, and switches to using a bit-vector when the set gets
larger than this.

Array is an implementation that keeps the elements of the points-to set
in an array that is always maintained in sorted order. Set membership is
tested using binary search, and set union and intersection are computed
using an algorithm based on the merge step from merge sort.

Double is an implementation that itself uses a pair of sets for
each points-to set. The first set in the pair stores new pointed-to
objects that have not yet been propagated, while the second set stores
old pointed-to objects that have been propagated and need not be
reconsidered. This allows the propagation algorithms to be incremental,
often speeding them up significantly.
END

MOPT doubleSetOld hash bit hybrid array
hybrid
Selects an implementation for the sets of old objects in the double
points-to set implementation.

This option has no effect unless setImpl is set to double.
END

MOPT doubleSetNew hash bit hybrid array
hybrid
Selects an implementation for the sets of new objects in the double
points-to set implementation.

This option has no effect unless setImpl is set to double.
END

SECTION Output Options
######################

BOPT dumpHTML
false
When this option is set to true, a browseable HTML representation of the
pointer assignment graph is output after the analysis completes. Note
that this representation is typically very large.
END

BOPT dumpPAG
false
When this option is set to true, a representation of the pointer assignment graph
suitable for processing with other solvers (such as the BDD-based solver) is
output before the analysis begins.
END

BOPT dumpSolution
false
When this option is set to true, a representation of the resulting points-to
sets is dumped. The format is similar to that of the dumpPAG
option, and is therefore suitable for comparison with the results of other
solvers.
END

BOPT topoSort
false
When this option is set to true, the representation dumped by the dumpPAG option
is dumped with the green nodes in (pseudo-)topological order.

This option has no effect unless dumpPAG is true.
END

BOPT dumpTypes
true
When this option is set to true, the representation dumped by the dumpPAG option
includes type information for all nodes.

This option has no effect unless dumpPAG is true.
END

BOPT classMethodVar
true
When this option is set to true, the representation dumped by the dumpPAG option
represents nodes by numbering each class, method, and variable within
the method separately, rather than assigning a single integer to each
node.

This option has no effect unless dumpPAG is true.
Setting classMethodVar to true has the effect of setting topoSort to false.
END

BOPT dumpAnswer
false
When this option is set to true, the computed reaching types for each variable are
dumped to a file, so that they can be compared with the results of
other analyses (such as the old VTA).
END

BOPT trimInvokeGraph
false
When this option is set to true, the results of the analysis are used to make the invoke graph
more precise after the analysis completes.
END

BOPT addTags
false
When this option is set to true, the results of the analysis are encoded inside
tags, and printed with the resulting Jimple code.
END
