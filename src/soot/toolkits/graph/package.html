Toolkit to produce and manipulate various types CFG graphs for Body instances. The CFG graphs
can have as nodes either Unit elements or Block elements the latter corresponding
to BasicBlocks of Units. Some of the classes produce graphs where the control flow for exceptions 
is taken into account, while others produce graph making abstraction of extra exception related 
edges. 

<b>All classes in this package should be thread save. (Thu Feb 10 00:03:48 EST 2000)</b>
