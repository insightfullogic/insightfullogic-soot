- Modified on July 29,1998 by Etienne Gagnon (gagnon@sable.mcgill.ca). (*)

    algorithm.
    
    2. Changed renameLocals. Gives a different name to address and error
    variables.

    3. Added -nosplitting and -oldtyping parameters.

    
Jimple 0.1 to Jimple 0.2 changes:

- Modified on July 22, 1998 by Raja Vallee-Rai (kor@sable.mcgill.ca). (*)
  
    1. Added a constructor to StmtListBody() which takes a Method as
    an argument, in order to simplify the process of producing a jimplified
    method.
    
    2. Added Jimple.setLocalPacking(), Jimple.setVerbose().  These are
    temporary fixes (do not depend on them too much, they might change
    in the near future.)
    
    3. Fixed a bug concerning the choosing of successors for RetStmt.
    (was choosing the NextStmt instead of the NextNextStmt)

    4. Deprecated Jimple.printBClass. (use Jimple.printClass instead) 
      
- Modified on July 5, 1998 by Etienne Gagnon (gagnon@sable.mcgill.ca) (*)
  
    1. Added a classpath parameter.
