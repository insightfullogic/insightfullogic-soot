<h3>CFG Data Flow Interaction for the Soot - Eclipse Plugin</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The main idea is to display Control Flow Graphs as Soot creates them and show the fixed point flow data sets as the are generated.</p>

<h4>Example</h4>
<img src="cfg_example.png">
<p>This example shows an example of a live variable analysis on part of a method. We can see the before and after flow sets that have been generated after several iterations.<p>

<h4>Controlling the Interaction</h4>
<p>There are 4 buttons for controlling the interaction.</p>
<img src="interaction_buttons.png">
<li>Step Forward - steps one step through the graph in a forward direction until there is no more data available for the method</li>
<li>Step Backward - steps one step back through the graph</li>
<li>Finish Method - steps through to the end of the method</li>
<li>Next Method - continues to the next method</li>
