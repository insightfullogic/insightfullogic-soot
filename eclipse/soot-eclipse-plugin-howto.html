Soot - Eclipse Plugin Usage
</title>
<body>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>
Once you have installed the soot-eclipse plugin and restarted Eclipse you must make the menus available by the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Select Window -- Customize Perspective</li>
<li>Expand Other option in the tree</li>
<li>Click on soot then OK</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now under the Project menu there should be a Soot section (the menu items may be grayed out at this point)
<p>

<p>
You must also switch to the Java Perspective in Eclipse:
<br>
Select Window -- Open Perspective -- Java
<br>
This isn't actually necessary to use Soot, but it is if you want to demonstrat that your Java class runs<br><p>

<p>
As Soot runs on java classes you must create or import some
Follow the Eclipse guidelines on creating a Java Project found at www.eclipse.org (look for Online Help section)
<br>
One note, currently there are problems with the soot plugin in you don't make a src folder in your Java project and instead use the project as the source folder. So don't do this.
<p>

<h4>
Running Soot on all the classes in your project:
</h4>

<ul>
<li>First build the classes.<li>
<li>Then select any java file in the project.<li>
<li>Then select Project -- Soot and any menu item under</li>


<ul>
<li><h5>There are currently four:</h5></li>
<li>Create Jimple - creates Jimple files</li>
<li>Dava Decompile - decompiles</li>
<li>Soot Options - opens a dialog box containing all Soot options</li> 
<li>Manage Configurations - opens a dialog where you can create and save, edit, remove and run different configurations of the Soot options</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>
Running Soot on imported folder of classes:
</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Select any class file. Right click and select Soot -- and any menu item (they are similar to the project menu items)</li>

<li>Select the foler. Right click and select Soot -- Dava Decompile (to decompile all the classes in your imported folder of classes)</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Running Soot on files:</h4>

<ul><li>
Select the file. Right click and select Soot -- and any menu item (they ar
e similar to the project menu items)</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Attributes:
</h4>

<p>
Selecting Output Options -- Output Format -- Jimple File
and under Jimple Annotations Pack: <br>
<br>
Null Pointer Check Options<br>
	-- unselect Disabled <br>
	-- select Only Array Ref<br>
<br>
Array Bounds Check Options<br>
	-- unselect Disabled<br>
	-- select With All<br>
<p>

<p>
Running this configuration causes a bunch of attribute tags to be generated.
After running open a generated Jimple File and there should be markers in the file indicating attributes.
Mouse over the line in the editor with a marker and you should see a tooltip with the attribute.
Also these attributes tooltips should appear in the original Java source file.
<p>

<h4>Using a Different Main Class<h4>

<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>
One other note: For long-running memory intensive Soot configurations Eclipse may run out of memory. To handle this start Eclipse with:<br>
eclipse -vmargs -Xmx300M
