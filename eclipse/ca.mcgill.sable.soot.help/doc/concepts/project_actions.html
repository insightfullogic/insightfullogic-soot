<h3>Project Actions</h3>
<p>These actions are available under the Project menu, under the Soot menu item.
The Soot menu item appears in the Project menu after selecting it from 
Window -&gt; Customize Perspective -&gt; Other -&gt; Soot</p>
<p>If the menu items are unavailable (greyed out): Select any file in the 
Package Explorer (in the project you wish to work on) and try again.</p>
<p>You must build the project before using Soot (as it works on .class files and not on .java files)</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Jimple - Selecting this menu item will create Jimple files corresponding to every class file in the project.</li>
<li>Dava Decompile - Selecting this menu item will cause Soot to decompile every class file in the project, creating a new Java file for each one.</li>
<li>Soot Options - There are about 182 options that one can use to in Soot (and the number grows frequently). Selecting this menu item will display a dialog box where you can choose from all the available options. This dialog makes no assumptions about how options interact with one another. For example: if you select an option that requires another option you must also select the other option, otherwise Soot will run and give you an error message.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Run - Runs the selected configuration.</li>
	<li>Close - Closes the dialog.</li>
	</ul>		
<li>Manage Soot Configurations - Selecting this menu item will display a dialog where you can create, edit, delete, etc your favorite Soot configurations. 
	<ul>
	<li>New - Creates a new configuration by first asking for a name (duplicate names are not permitted) and displaying the Soot Options dialog where you will have a "Save" instead of "Run" button available.</li>
	<li>Edit - Displays the Soot Options dialog and allows you to make any changes (or none) and to Save them.</li>
	<li>Delete - Deletes the selected configuration. Don't worry, a confirmation dialog pops up when this is selected in case you didn't really mean it.</li>
	<li>Rename - This gives you the option to give a new name to the selected configuration.</li>
	<li>Clone - This gives you the ability to make an exact copy of the options in the selected configuration but with a different name.</li>
	<li>Run - Runs the selected configuration.</li>
	<li>Close - Closes the dialog.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
