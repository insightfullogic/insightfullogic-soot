Todo (as of 1.2.2)
1. waiting for more improvements on speed and memory usage
   John is working on that.
2. how soot works on other VMs ( such as Kaffe )

Todo (as of 1.2.1)
1. test new command line options provided by Fabien

Open problems (as of 1.2.0):

1. improve our naming scheme to make Soot run on Macintosh.
2. improve the invoke graph builder.
3. include an interprocedural flow analysis framework
      and improve the whole-program analysis features.
4. improve soot.toolkits.graph.Block so that we keep a state counter for
      the Body and don't trample stuff; this is needed to keep the 
      BlockLength up to date.  Actually, that is somewhat complicated.
