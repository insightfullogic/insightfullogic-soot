Todo (as of 1.2.4)
1. continued work on Spark (points-to) package, Ondrej
2. SSA-Jimple (Navindra)
3. Decompiler (Jerome)
4. Solve UnitGraph for infinite loops (without exit points).
5. More projects from CS621.
6. Precise exception modelling (John)
7. Java 1.4 support.

Todo (as of 1.2.3)
1. Spark (points-to) package, Ondrej
2. SSA-Jimple (Navindra)
3. Decompiler (Jerome)
4. Solve UnitGraph for infinite loops (without exit points).
5. More projects from CS621.

Todo (as of 1.2.2)
1. waiting for more improvements on speed and memory usage
   John is working on that.
2. how soot works on other VMs ( such as Kaffe )

Todo (as of 1.2.1)
1. test new command line options provided by Fabien

Open problems (as of 1.2.0):

1. improve our naming scheme to make Soot run on Macintosh.
2. improve the invoke graph builder.
3. include an interprocedural flow analysis framework
      and improve the whole-program analysis features.
4. improve soot.toolkits.graph.Block so that we keep a state counter for
      the Body and don't trample stuff; this is needed to keep the 
      BlockLength up to date.  Actually, that is somewhat complicated.
