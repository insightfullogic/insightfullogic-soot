For the next release of Soot, we will improve the whole-program analysis
features.

improve soot.toolkits.graph.Block so that we keep a state counter for
the Body and don't trample stuff; this is needed to keep the BlockLength up
to date.  Actually, that is somewhat complicated.

------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1.0
Next release to do:
 1) improve the temporary file name scheme to make the Soot run 
    on Macintosh.
 2) improve the invoke graph builder.
